Description
This program simulates a metro system and uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two stations. The metro system is represented as a cyclic graph, where each station is a node, and the distances between stations are the edges. The program calculates the shortest path, total distance, and total waiting time for two possible routes (forward and backward) and suggests the best path based on the total time.

Features
Graph Representation:
->The metro system is represented as a cyclic graph with stations as nodes and distances as edges.

->Distances between stations are randomly generated between 1 and 5 km.

Dijkstra's Algorithm:

->The program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting station to the destination station.
